 Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated a reassuring opportunity to develop powerful and dynamic industrial systems and applications by making use of universality of sensors, actuators and network connectivity. IoT can immensely benefit people when used in the medical field. Non-adherence to a medical routine is a major problem faced by patients. According to the World Health Organization, increasing the effectiveness of adherence interventions may have a far greater impact on the health of the population than any improvement in specific medical treatments. In an attempt to address this problem, a special system that monitors and tracks the consumption of medicine of any patient is presented. Adherence needs are met through the implementation of a mobile application. The result of this will be timely consumption of the medicine by the patients.
